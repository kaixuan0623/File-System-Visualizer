# File-System-Visualizer

A Python project that, given a path which points to a folder in you computer, it can visualize how the file system is organized by drawing some colourful rectangles on screen, 
each of which represents a file that the size of each rectangle is proportional to its real size.

And this program also provides some operations that can be used to modified the display size of each file (but not real size of them) to see what will happen to the whole system.

Also this program can also do some more general things in visualize how a system with some numeral attribute organized, and possibly can visualize a dynamic chance of this system. 

The tree map system is a general interface, and file system is just a one particular implementation of it, and I also implemented a PopulationTree which retrieve population data from World Bank API and get a nice interactive graphical representation of this data.
